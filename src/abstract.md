# Anoma

> TODO: Abstract.

These documents describe the architecture of the Anoma protocol. They are intended to be _complete_, in that enough is said to define precisely what a valid implementation of Anoma must do, and _minimal_, in that no more is said than that.

Anoma is free, in both the senses of "free speech" and "free beer". The source for these documents is [on Github](https://github.com/anoma/specs), permissively licensed, and they can be forked or edited as you like. At present, this particular repository is stewarded by the [Anoma Foundation](https://anoma.foundation/). Contributions are welcome.

> **NOTE:** For clarity, the word "Anoma" is used to refer to three separate but related entities:
> - The Anoma _protocol_, which is defined in this specification.
> - The Anoma _network_, which is the network of nodes which use the Anoma protocol.
> - The Anoma _Foundation_, which is a Swiss foundation (Stiftung) chartered with support & coordination of the Anoma ecosystem.
> <br /><br />In this document, "Anoma" alone refers to the Anoma protocol.

> **NOTE:** These documents are not yet complete. If you're reading this page right now, there's a high chance you might be interested in [Namada](https://namada.net).

Happy reading!
