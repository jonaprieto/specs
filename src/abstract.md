# Anoma

Anoma is a cybernetic consensus system for scale-free cryptographic accounting of causal dependence.

- causal dependence = what depended on what
- accounting = tracking through time, rewarding
- cryptographic = integrity provided by cryptographic assumptions
- scale-free = no preferred level of individuality
- consensus = agreement on history
- cybernetic = measure fed back

Using Anoma, nodes can create, merge, and verify cryptographically content-addressed histories in a manner which enforces a distributed linear resource logic. This distributed resource logic is used as the substrate for a cryptographic accounting system which provides a local, quantifiable view of entanglement, a measure of gains from cooperation (or, correspondingly, loss to defection). This measure of entanglement can be fed back into the system to inform local choices which require trust, such as delegation of data storage and consensus provisioning, allowing for automatic reduction of computational resource expenditure in high-entanglement interactions. This measure can also be input into and output from the system in order to track relations of interdependence in the external world.

These documents describe the architecture of Anoma. They are intended to be both _minimal_, in that no more is said than necessary, and _complete_, in that enough is said to define precisely what a valid implementation of Anoma must do.

Anoma is free, in both the senses of "free speech" and "free beer". The source for these documents is [on Github](https://github.com/anoma/specs), permissively licensed, and they can be forked or edited as you like. At present, this particular repository is stewarded by the [Anoma Foundation](https://anoma.foundation/). Contributions are welcome.

This specification is designed be readable in both breadth-first and depth-first manners.
