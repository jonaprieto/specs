# Anoma

Anoma is a cybernetic consensus system for causal accounting. Using Anoma, agents can create, merge, and verify cryptographically content-addressed histories in a manner which enforces arbitrary logical relations, including directed and undirected identity relationships and a distributed linear resource logic. These logics are used as the substrate for a cryptographic accounting system which provides a quantifiable view of _entanglement_, a pairwise measure of the degree of a particular kind of relationship between two identities. This measure of entanglement can be fed back into the system to inform local choices which require trust, such as delegation of data storage and consensus provisioning, allowing for automatic reduction of computational resource expenditure in high-entanglement interactions. This measure can also be input into and output from the system in order to track relations of interdependence in the external world.

Consensus over history in conjunction with user data input allows for the provisioning of _causal accounting_, in that the system can combine local information about local causal dependence and local agent preferences into a gestalt system model of causal and preference relations, and provide pairwise and relative measures of preference satisfaction as outputs which can be used for resource provisioning decisions in the future. 

Anoma's architecture is _scale-free_, in that the system's fundamental unit of cryptographic identity is closed under composition, so the system can model relational topologies spanning arbitrary levels of individuality. 
 
Anoma provides _computational integrity_ (correctness) and _informational locality_ (privacy) on the basis of cryptographic assumptions. The protocol architecture abstracts cryptographic primitives by their information-theoretic properties, so implementations of particular primitives can be chosen and updated for availability, maturity, and performance over time.

These documents describe the architecture of the Anoma protocol. They are intended to be _complete_, in that enough is said to define precisely what a valid implementation of Anoma must do, and _minimal_, in that no more is said than that.

Anoma is free, in both the senses of "free speech" and "free beer". The source for these documents is [on Github](https://github.com/anoma/specs), permissively licensed, and they can be forked or edited as you like. At present, this particular repository is stewarded by the [Anoma Foundation](https://anoma.foundation/). Contributions are welcome.

This specification is designed be readable in both breadth-first and depth-first manners.
