# Angles of approach

Anoma can be viewed through the lens of many different languages and compared to many different classes of existing systems. No angle is more correct than another, but particular angles may be more effective in converying what the system is to individuals or groups with different backgrounds in prior work. Here we cover four areas of particular relevance:

- [Distributed ledger architecture](./angles-of-approach/distributed-ledger-architecture.md) decribes how Anoma relates to existing distributed ledger systems and blockchain architecture paradigms.
- [Cybernetics of coordination](./angles-of-approach/cybernetics-of-coordination.md) describes how Anoma can be seen as a cybernetic accounting system for assemblage of local inputs into system-level resource allocation decisions.
- [Anthropology of money](./angles-of-approach/anthropology-of-money.md) describes how Anoma can be seen as the digital substrate which might allow for a return of scale-invariant credit money.
- [Web-of-trust history](./angles-of-approach/web-of-trust-history.md) describes how Anoma relates to and unifies other web-of-trust systems (both centralised and decentralised).

It is not necessary, however, for the reader to understand Anoma through one or more of these lenses - the protocol can be understood from scratch, and the remainder of this document attempts to explain it as so. If you don't think any of these lenses will be helpful for you, or you want to try to understand the protocol without a specific basis of comparison, skip ahead to [section 3](./architecture.md).
