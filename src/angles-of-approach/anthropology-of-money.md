# Anthropology of money
Zooming out (a lot), the progression of money throughout human history can be understood as having four main stages:

- Intangible, decentralised (small-community high-trust credit accounting), where scarcity is enforced by high-density gossip.
- Tangible, centralised (state-backed low-trust rare metal accounting), where scarcity is enforced by physical difficulty of procurement.
- Intangible, centralised (state-backed digital accounting), where scarcity is enforced by centrally-controlled digital systems and a legal monopoly on force.
- Intangible, decentralised (cryptocurrency), where scarcity is enforced by opt-in protocol and verified by everyone.
At present, we live in the third stage. Anoma provides a substrate for the fourth stage - but it should also be understood that in this fourth stage the definition of "money" is really quite different from the third (the definitions of the first stage and the fourth stage are probably closest), as fungible and non-fungible tokens as implemented by Anoma carry no particular semantic association - they are as valuable or as worthless as users decide them to be, and correspond or don't correspond to particular features of the world in accordance with decisions taken by users. For example, a particular denomination could be used to measure CO2 sequestered, another could be used to measure water levels, another to measure health outcomes, etc. - not things we would typically think of as money in the current paradigm. Anoma is merely an accounting system, it deals in syntax and structure - but the semantics of the relationship to the real world are entirely up to the users.
