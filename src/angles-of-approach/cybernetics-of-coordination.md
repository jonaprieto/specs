# Cybernetics of coordination

> TODO: Still to be rewritten properly, ignore me for now.

Anoma can be understood as a cybernetic consensus system for causal accounting, in that the system can combine local information about local causal dependence and local agent preferences into a gestalt system model of causal and preference relations, and provide pairwise and relative measures of preference satisfaction as outputs which can be used for resource provisioning decisions in the future. Different measures of entanglement can be fed back into the system to inform local choices which require trust, such as delegation of data storage and consensus provisioning, allowing for automatic reduction of computational resource expenditure in high-entanglement interactions. 

Anoma's architecture is _scale-free_, in that the system's fundamental unit of cryptographic identity is closed under composition, so the system can model relational topologies spanning arbitrary levels of individuality. Under the assumption of an inverse-power law with regards to economic distance, the network of real relations viewed from outside will take the form of a fractal, i.e. recurrence of form independent of scale.
