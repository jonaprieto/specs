# Anoma vis-a-vis Ethereum

Ethereum originally aimed to provide a "world computer", a goal which is perhaps laudable but vague, both in that it does not clearly bound the class of applications for which a world computer would be appropriate, and because it fails to engage with the real political economy of polycentric infrastructural sovereignty. Over the years, as market structures became clearer, the base protocol has focused its efforts, and the ecosystem has stratified into several layers. For this reason, we compare Anoma to the Ethereum _base layer_ and to the Ethereum _ecosystem_ separately, since they are now addressing differently bounded design problems.

### Base layer

Ethereum base layer = minimalist settlement. 

Could be a settlement option for Anoma

### Ecosystem

- Rollups/layer 2s
- MEV
- Mesh security 
- fractal scaling - implementation of all n layers
- mesh security - scale-free implementation architecture
