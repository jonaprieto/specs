# Anoma vis-a-vis Zcash

> TODO: Stub, to be expanded.

Compared to the Zcash political philosophy, Anoma decouples assets from the protocol - Anoma takes preservation of privacy as a feature of counterparty discovery and settlement rails, not as a property of any particular asset.

Compared to the Zcash protocol, Anoma unifies the privacy-preserving double-spend prevention technique of Zerocash/Zcash/Zexe - nullifiers, uniquely binding to note commitments, unlinkable and calculable with secret information - with the double-spend prevention required of distributed database systems / blockchains (preventing multiple valid conflicting descendents of the same block), recasting the mechanism as a distributed enforcement system for a linear resource logic.
