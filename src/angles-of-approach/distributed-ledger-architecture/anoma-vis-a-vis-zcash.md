# Anoma vis-a-vis Zcash

- decouple assets and protocols
- privacy is a feature of counterparty discovery and settlement rails, not assets
- We unify the privacy-preserving double-spend prevention technique of Zerocash/Zexe/Taiga - nullifiers, uniquely binding to note commitments, unlinkable and calculable with secret information - with the double-spend prevention required of distributed database systems / blockchains (preventing multiple valid conflicting descendents of the same block), recasting the mechanism as a distributed enforcement system for a linear resource logic.
