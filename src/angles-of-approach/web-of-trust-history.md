# Web-of-trust history

Many systems have tried to instantiate a digitally recorded web-of-trust. GnuPG, Facebook, Twitter, and the financial system can all be understood as particular special cases, focused, respectively, on cryptographic attestation chains, bidirectional relationships, unidirectional relationships, and fungible relationships, respectively. Anoma provides a general protocol substrate for a web-of-trust which does not make specific decisions about bidirectionality/unidirectionality, fungibility/non-fungibility, etc., but rather supports modelling all of these kinds of relationships and leaves the semantics up to the user. Although based on cryptography, Anoma also incorporates history, such that the capability connoted by a key can be expressed not merely as possession of private information but also as a coincidence of relationships (e.g. social key recovery). Anoma also aims to standardise the protocol but make no decisions about how to interface with it, such that different interfaces can be crafted which provide visual and interaction designs appropriate for the semantics of particular kinds of relationships.
