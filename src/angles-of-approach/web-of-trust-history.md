# Web-of-trust history
Many prior protocols and companies have tried to instantiate a digitally recorded web-of-trust. GnuPG, Facebook, Twitter, and the financial system can all be understood as particular special cases, focused, respectively, on cryptographic attestation chains, bidirectional relationships, unidirectional relationships, and fungible relationships. Anoma provides a general protocol substrate for a heterogeneous web-of-trust which does not make specific decisions about bidirectionality/unidirectionality, fungibility/non-fungibility, etc., but rather supports modelling all of these kinds of relationships and leaves the semantics up to the user. Although based on cryptography, Anoma also incorporates history, such that the capability connoted by a key can be expressed not merely as possession of private information but also as a coincidence of relationships (e.g. social key recovery). Anoma standardises the protocol but make no decisions about how to interface with it, such that different interfaces can be crafted which provide visual and interaction designs appropriate for the semantics of particular kinds of relationships. By standardising a heterogeneous trust, privacy-preserving protocol, Anoma aims to provide a credibly neutral language for a logically unified web-of-trust, where users own their relationships and control with whom they share their data. Only such credible neutrality allows for agreement on a single protocol, and agreement on a single protocol is necessary to avoid the welfare loss of multiple mutually compatible systems and principal-agent problem of privately controlled walled gardens.
