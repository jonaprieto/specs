# Attestation
_Attestations_ are non-transferable credentials associated with an issuing party (making the attestation) and a party about which they attest something (the receiver of the credential). Attestations can include arbitrary data, which may be meaningful (e.g. the details of a specific degree earned), and can be verified by other parties in a transaction.

Attestations can be used as a form of representation for [ï»¿soulbound tokens](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763).
