# Proof-of-stake
- Tokens of a particular denomination can be locked for a configurable period of time in a non-fungible bond
- Bond can be claimed in the future with rewards as indicated (fixed-rate or variable-rate)
- Bond can be soulbound (?)
- Bond carries voting rights (perhaps somewhat proportional to lockup length)
- Bond is associated with a specific validator selection function
    - Owner of the bond may redelegate (or equivalent)
- Bond gains stake-weighted voting power on funding allocation decisions (logistic function)
- Bonds can also be offered by the protocol for locking other assets 
    - Incentive alignment mechanism
    - Coupons still pay out in staking asset
- Targeting controller sets interest (targeting lockup profiles of different denominations)
    - Protocol can also buy back bonds
    - Could include bonds of other denominations
    - Pro rata redemption (exit) is allowed, with a controller-determined tax
Additional options

- Non-transferable bonds (requires some kind of anti-collusion anti-transfer mechanism)
- Free gas per unit time for stakers (non-transferable)
