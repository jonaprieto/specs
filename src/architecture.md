# Architecture
The architecture section is organised into five sub-sections:

- [﻿Host requirements](./architecture/host-requirements.md)  describes the basic characteristics and functions which machines must have in order to run Anoma.
- [﻿Prerequisite primitives](./architecture/prerequisite-primitives.md)  describes the basic cryptographic primitives of which Anoma makes use.
- [﻿Basic types](./architecture/basic-types.md)  describes the basic types used through the protocol.
- [﻿Logics](./architecture/logics.md)  describes the stateless logics of the protocol.
- [﻿Engines](./architecture/engines.md)  describes the engines of the protocol and their composition.
