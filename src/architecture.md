# Architecture

The architecture section is organised into five sub-sections:

- [Host requirements](./architecture/host-requirements.md) describes the basic characteristics and functions which machines must have in order to run Anoma.
- [Prerequisite primitives](./architecture/prerequisite-primitives.md) describes the basic cryptographic primitives of which Anoma makes use.
- [Basic types](./architecture/basic-types.md) describes the basic types used through the protocol.
- [Logics](./architecture/logics.md) describes the stateless logics of the protocol.
- [Engines](./architecture/engines.md) describes the engines of the protocol and their composition.
