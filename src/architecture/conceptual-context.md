# Conceptual context

## Agents

Observers are assumed to have the ability to store data (privately via locality), perform compute, and send and receive messages over an arbitrary, asynchronous physical network (~ Turing machine with a network).

## World

partial ordering, partial connectivity

We assume an asynchronous physical network in the general case, where liveness w.r.t. some message set and some observers will require eventual receipt of all messages in the set by the observers in question.
