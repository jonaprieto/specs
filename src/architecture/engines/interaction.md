# Interaction

- *Inputs*
    User instructions (trusted) incl. intents (abstract?), queries, sub/unsub to subsets of state changes
- *Outputs*
    Query results, intent execution results, relevant state changes, 
- *Preferences*
- *Accounting*

interaction engine is responsible for interfacing with physical local system
local randomness, local input
even local storage?
only part that does I/O

- randomness
    - should come from interaction engine only
    - whole system should be deterministic otherwise
    - time should also come from interaction engine
