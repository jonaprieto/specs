# Entanglement

what _is_ entanglement?

entanglement is a relation between identities

maps a pair of identities to a numerical measure

example measures of entanglement from different logical DAGs:
- bilateral relationship
- directed relationship
- cryptographic-kudos
  - liquidity (normalised)
  - volume? (normalised)
  - price (normalised)
- physical latency  
- external (user) input
  - independent from input to system, could be an override

entanglement used to make decisions about:
- consensus provider selection
- storage provider selection
- trusted delegate compute selection
- gossip paths for intents which might leak data?
- preferential information in the case of price uncertainty (w/o batch auctions)

can also select by the inverted measure:
- anti-correlation
  - e.g. holding anti-correlated kudos portfolio

or with other characteristics in mind:
- redundancy (e.g. for storage)

entanglement can also be used for decisions in the physical world
- access control
- resource limitations

entanglement can be _proven_ from the logical DAG, generally
- does, however, often require private information
- can be proved to some other party in ZK
