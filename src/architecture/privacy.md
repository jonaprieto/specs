# Privacy

should cover uses of cryptography incl. zkps, fhe, 

- how to model privacy for consensus providers? threshold encryption, internal rules of processing, threshold decryption ==> should work
- ditto for threshold fhe, just never decrypt, do operations, decrypt result
- fhe w/separate keys => no identity relation (at this layer), just predicates which encode the fhe stuff in them
